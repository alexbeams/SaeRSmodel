# SaeRSmodel
Codes used to generate figures for the manuscript "Mathematical models of the SaeRS gene regulatory network reveal the potential for switch-like behavior"

file description:

R Code
- ramping_experiment_figure.R produces Figure 5

  
Maple codes
- nondimensional_model_diagram.mw tries to generate a bifurcation diagram for the independent binding model in the main text. It produces a one-parameter bifurcation diagram which looks qualitatively similar to the one in the next file, but the formulas are a bit too cumbersome to generate a 2-parameter bifurcation diagram
- nondimensional_model_diagram_saturated.mw produces Figure 6 and Figure 7.
- nondimensional_dimerization_model.mw tries to generate a bifurcation diagram for the dimerization binding model in the appendix of the main text. It produces a one-parameter bifurcation diagram which looks qualitatively similar to the one in the next file, but the formulas are a bit too cumbersome to generate a 2-parameter bifurcation diagram
- nondimensional_dimerization_model_saturated.mw produces Figure A1 and Figure A2
